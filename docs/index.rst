A Python library for Monash University School of Physics & Astronomy students
=============================================================================
This Python library contains helpful Python functions and utilities that will be used in Physics & Astronomy classes at Monash University.

This documentation is not meant to replace your study resources for individual activities (which you can find on the `Monash LMS`_) but does document every function and every option available to use, which you might find useful as a reference.
