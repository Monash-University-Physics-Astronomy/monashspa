We recommend installing `monashspa` from the Python Package Index. To do this, open a terminal (linux/OSX) or command prompt (Windows) window, and run::

    pip install monashspa

Upgrading monashspa
-------------------

To upgrade to the latest version of `monashspa`, run::

    pip install -U monashspa
    
To upgrade to a specific version of `monashspa` (or, alternatively, if you wish to downgrade), run::

    pip install -U monashspa==<version>
    
where :code:`<version>` is replaced by the version you wish (for example :code:`pip install -U monashspa==0.1.0`).
